This program implements a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on each guess and congratulates the user upon a correct guess, indicating the number of attempts made. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number. i learnt how to properly use
Conditional Statements:
The use of if, else if, and else statements for making decisions based on the user's input compared to the randomly generated secret number.
Variable Declaration and Initialization:
The use of var to declare variables (attempts and userGuess) and the short variable declaration := for concise variable declaration and initialization.
Error Handling:
The use of error handling to manage unexpected situations, such as when the user enters non-integer input.
Console Output:
The use of fmt.Println to print messages to the console, providing information and feedback to the user.
Loop Control (continue, break):
The use of continue to skip the rest of the loop body and move on to the next iteration in case of invalid user input.
The use of break to exit the loop when the correct guess is made.
